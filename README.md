# Tabata`s Confectionery

## Description
This is a comprehensive web application designed for a fictitious confectionery business. The application enables users to view the available products, add or remove products to/from their cart, and place an order. Additionally, the application offers the business owner the ability to add, edit, or delete products. It includes different role levels, such as admin, owner, employee, and customer, each with varying degrees of functionality access. The Front-end of the application is built using React and TypeScript, while the Back-end uses Flask and Python and is powered by a PostgreSQL database. The application is hosted on Netlify for the Front-end, Fly.io for the Back-end, and Bit.io for the database.

## Getting Started
  The project can be accessed on **[my GitHub profile on pastry-fe repository,](https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/pastry-fe)** **[and the Back-end on the pastry-be repository.](https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/pastry-be)**

  ### Back-end
  1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/pastry-be.git
  2. install pipenv using `pip install pipenv`
  3. install dependencies using `pipenv install`
  4. Create your PostgreSQL database local server (i`m using pgAdmin 4)
  5. Seed the database using `pipenv run python seed.py`
  6. Run the application using `pipenv run flask run`


  ### Front-end
  1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/scarlosteixeira/pastry-fe.git
  2. install dependencies using `npm install`
  3. Make sure that the back-end is running
  4. Run the application using `npm run dev`

## Brief

### Technical Requirements

You must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Flask API** using a Flask REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app** hosted on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories/wireframes** â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application, if applicable
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
